4-13. Buﬀet: A buﬀet-style restaurant oﬀers only ﬁve basic foods. Think of ﬁve simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
 Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant oﬀers. Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python 
 rejects the change. The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with diﬀerent foods. Add a line that 
 rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.
